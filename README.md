## Usage

After installing the bot, you can use the `/weather` (or `/weatherbot`, if `/weather` is already in use) command to get forecasts for any location, such as:

* `/weather 20001`
* `/weather in washington, dc`
* `/weather at 1600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc`

You can also visit the home tab for the app in Slack to see a more detailed forecast for a location of your choice.
